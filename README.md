# SEW/INSY 

This week's exercise consists of several parts.

A friend of yours is playing chess all day. He wants to extract the data from his games.

He is using chesscorps "chess-club" for his training.

You can install your own instance from Docker Hub.

https://hub.docker.com/r/chesscorp/chess-club

Take care of installing it with persistent data.

Please analyze the database system and extract an ER-Diagram at least for the part of storing a game and its moves.

Think about how to store a complete chess game, including all moves, within a CSV file.

Develop a class Diagram of a tool that extracts the chess club game data into the given CSV file format.

Implement the tool, following usual coding rules (module head comments, method and class comments, descriptively named functions, methods, members and variables)

Implement unit testing for your code modules.

Take care that the result must be package-able software. (e.g., a Python pip package containing setup.py)
